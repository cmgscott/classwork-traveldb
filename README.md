# TravelDB

Final submission for Database system design class. Very few changes have been made. This includes the Java code to create the GUI and connect to the SQL Server database, and the SQL code to create the database. I've also included the sample queries we were tasked to included in our submissions.

## Getting Started

First, the database needs to be created in SQL Server. At this time this is not a built-in functionality of the GUI code in Java. Simply execute the code backend.sql to create the database. After the database is created it can be accessed by the Java GUI.

Run Main.java in the project folder to run the GUI.

To run the sample queries, the database must be created separately.

## Important note

This project was submitted for a database class. We were instructed to focus on the database itself, and therefore the Java code is admittedly messy and unideal. This will hopefully incrementally improve over the next several weeks.
